Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Artemis Financial is a consultying firm that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations and use the most current and effective software security. The company wants to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications. 
So, when the web application is used to transfer data, the company will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum.
I focused on applying secure coding best practices like input validation, secure API handling, encryption with SHA-256, and proper error handling. 
Coding securely is important because it protects client data, helps the company stay compliant, and builds trust. All of those are critical for a company to have long-term success.
One part of the vulnerability assessment that was both challenging and helpful was reviewing the full application architecture and making sure the new security did not throw errors. 
I added layers of security by improving encryption.
In the future, I would continue using tools like OWASP guidelines, dependency-checkers, and manual code reviews to find vulnerabilities and decide how to fix them. 
After refactoring the code, I made sure everything was still functional and secure by doing full testing and reviewing reports to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. 
Secure coding practices, automated scanning tools, and encryption techniques I used in this project will definitely help in future assignments too. 
For future employers, this project shows I can identify risks, fix vulnerabilities, and deliver secure, reliable software.
